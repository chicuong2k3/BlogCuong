# Introduction to Bitcoin and Blockchain

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency and serves as a model for autonomous decentralized applications. It was created by an enigmatic figure named Satoshi Nakamoto and released in 2009.

Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer exchanges without the need for any financial intermediary. For example, when you buy rice and pay 20k directly to the seller in exchange for 1kg of rice, this transaction is a peer-to-peer exchange.
Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology.

## Blockchain

Blockchain is a technology that allows peer machines to transact within a decentralized network. Transactions are recorded in an immutable distributed ledger.

## Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems

For instance, when you shop at a supermarket and pay using a bank card, this transaction involves several parties such as the central bank and the supermarket, representing a centralized system.

In a decentralized system, people can transact directly with each other, with intermediaries replaced by peer-to-peer networks, where peers do not need to know each other. How can trust be established among these unknown peers?

Trust is achieved through a process involving steps:

Validating, verifying, and authenticating transactions.
Recording transactions in an immutable distributed ledger.
Creating tamper-proof records of blocks.
Implementing a consensus protocol to ensure agreement is recorded on the chain.
For example, if An borrows 1 million from Bay, both record the debt in their ledgers without any witness. Thus, An could alter the debt to 100k, or Bay could change it to 2 million. To prevent such tampering, they make a copy of the ledger and have their friend Tam hold it as proof. This mirrors the concept of an immutable distributed ledger. If An or Bay wants to verify the transaction, they can ask Tam to check the ledger. If the three ledgers do not match, the transaction is invalidated.
