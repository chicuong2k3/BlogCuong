# The First Day with Electrical Engineering

Although being a software engineer, I have interested in Electrical Engineering since I was a secondary school student. Therefore, I want to write something that I have learnt as a way to kill time. The first thing I would like to talk about is Mathematics, a subject that I also like very much.

I will not mention some basic concepts like Sets, Relations and Functions here. You can read it in other materials.
